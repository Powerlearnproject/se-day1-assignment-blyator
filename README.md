# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968 NATO Conference coined the term software engineering
1970s in troduction of Structured Programming
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement Analysis
Design
Implementation 
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall uses linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., building a house).

Agile on the other hand is  iterative and incremental approach that allows for flexibility and continuous feedback. Suitable for projects with evolving requirements (e.g., developing a mobile app).




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing, improving developer productivity. example is visual studio code

VCS track changes to code, facilitate collaboration, and allow for version control and rollback. example is Git



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Ever changing requirements. Strategy is to use Agile methodologies to accommodate changes.

Tight deadlines. Strategy is to prioritize tasks and use time management techniques.

Communication gaps. Strategy includes regular meetings and clear documentation.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or modules. This ensures each part functions correctly.

Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between integrated modules. Ensures they work together as expected.

System Testing: Tests the complete system. Ensures it meets the specified requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Conducted by the end-user. Ensures the software meets their needs and is ready for deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the science of crafting effective prompts to genearte desired responses from AI models. It is important because Well-crafted prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses. Also reduces the need for multiple iterations and finally allows users to guide the AI's behavior and output more precisely.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about history of kenyan independence.

Improved Prompt: Provide a summary of the key events of the Mau Mau

The improved prompt is clear, specific and concise.
